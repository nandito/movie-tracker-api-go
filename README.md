# Movie Tracker API

This app was completely generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT, even this README file
(except this current paragraph). I've sent 17 messages to ChatGPT to make the
app work. (There was a small confusion around how to use the
[mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) module, so I fixed that by myself).

This is a simple Go API server for tracking movies and TV shows. It allows
users to add movies and TV shows to a database, list the movies and TV shows in
the database, update movie and TV show entries, and delete movies and TV shows
from the database.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.15 or later
- SQLite3

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nandito/movie-tracker-api.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd movie-tracker-api`
3. Build the project: `go build`
4. Run the server: `./movie-tracker-api`

## API Endpoints

| GET    | /movies  | Lists all movies and TV shows in the database |

## Testing

To run the tests for this project, use the `go test` command from the project
root directory:

```sh
go test
```

The tests can be found in the `*_test.go` files located in the project root
directory.

To run a specific test or a group of tests, you can use the `-run` flag with
the `go test` command and specify a regular expression to match the names of
the tests:

```sh
go test -run TestAddMovieHandler
```

To enable verbose output, including the output of the tests, you can use the
`-v` flag:

```sh
go test -v
```

To generate a coverage report, you can use the `-cover` flag and specify the
output file with the `-coverprofile` flag:

```sh
go test -cover -coverprofile=coverage.out
```

To view the coverage report, you can use the `go tool cover` command and
specify the output file:

```sh
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```
