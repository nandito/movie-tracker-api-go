# Movie Tracker API

This app was completely generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT, even this README file
(except this current paragraph). I've sent 17 messages to ChatGPT to make the
app work. (There was a small confusion around how to use the
[mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) module, so I fixed that by myself).

This is a simple Go API server for tracking movies and TV shows. It allows
users to add movies and TV shows to a database, list the movies and TV shows in
the database, update movie and TV show entries, and delete movies and TV shows
from the database.

## Prerequisites
